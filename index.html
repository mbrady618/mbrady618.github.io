            <p>This video was developed for a motion graphics class at UMGC.  The assignment was to create a video that demonstrated kinetic typography using a speech or poem.</p>
            <p>I wanted to use source material that felt familiar to audiences, and this poem by William Shakespeare is widely recognized. I also thought it would be interesting to pair it with a musical style that wouldn’t typically be associated with Shakespeare.</p>  
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>I built the entire video as a single composition in Adobe After Effects, incorporating music so that the text would appear, move, and animate in harmony with it. I designed most of the visuals but sourced some graphical elements from stock imagery websites.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I’ve done many motion graphic projects in this style because I enjoy editing directly to music, creating animations that naturally flow with the beat. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>I used a variety of colors that corresponded with the words, strategically emphasizing key terms to make them stand out. My goal was to create a visual rhythm that made the viewer feel as though they were "hearing" the words in sync with the beat of the music, while also ensuring the meaning was conveyed quickly and clearly.</p>

            <p>This video was developed at the request of former Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein.  It was played at the annual Air, Space & Cyber Conference in 2017 to communicate his vision for the future of U.S. Military Command and Control.</p>
            <p>It demonstrates a theoretical scenario in which the warfare “domains” (air, ground, space, etc) work in unison to accomplish a mission. Control centers around the globe would be connected through a network that recommends options and calculates the probability of success for each action.</p>  
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>To create the environment, I set up three computer monitors in a studio and lit the scene with plenty of mood and contrast to make it feel like a control room.  I used different color gels so the audience could easily distinguish when the location changed.  </p>
            <p>I designed the computer interface for each domain using Adobe After Effects.  This was the most time-intensive step, because the computer screen actions needed to match what was happening in the script.  I recorded the actors tapping and swiping the screens, which were simply playing the videos I created. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>Some of the extra b-roll (such as vehicles and aircraft) came from video archives. I did all the camera work for the "control center" footage and edited the entire video, focusing heavily on sound design and creating most of the motion graphic elements.</p>

            Date: 07/30/2023<br>
            48 Hour Film Project, Baltimore
            </p></div>
            <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>This video was created for a 48-hour film festival where teams of filmmakers had only two days to write, shoot, and edit a short film. The required elements, including a character, a prop, and a phrase, were revealed when the event kicked off. Each team was also randomly assigned two genres and had to produce their film in the style of one or both. </p>
            <p>Our genres were "romance" and "medical." We had to feature a prop that was pink, a character named Rita Pelepano (a farmer's market vendor), and incorporate "that is not what I had in mind" into the script.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>Friday night, my team of three brainstormed story ideas and stayed up most of the night writing the script. We wanted to use both genres to show that we didn’t have a pre-written story. This is one of my favorite parts of the process because I thrive in a group dynamic where we build off each other's ideas.</p>
            <p>We started shooting the next morning at a predesignated location with actors we knew. I served as director of photography and was one of two camera operators. That night was spent doing post-production with very little rest. Two of us took turns editing or sleeping.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>The video was due that evening, but by noon we realized it was well over the maximum time limit and had to cut nearly 5 minutes. After a few rushed hours, we managed to trim it down while keeping a good flow and successfully maintaining a solid story arc. The film ultimately won an award for Cinematography at the culmination event.</p>

            <p>This video was developed for the annual DC Video Shootoff, which is a not-for-profit video workshop for military and civil service videographers that focuses on storytelling fundamentals and provides mentorship and instruction regarding various aspects of video production. </p>
            <p>I was part of the social media team and was tasked to create a video that promoted the event and highlighted that the teams were about to begin filming.</p>  
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>My initial vision was to creatively depict how a team might assemble video gear to shoot their story. I thought it would be fun to emulate how a movie might show an agent gearing up for a mission.</p>
            <p>I used dynamic lighting to highlight various pieces of equipment that resembled tactical gear, capturing close-up shots of the action. During the edit, I added sci-fi-inspired sound effects to enhance the illusion and give the sequence an engaging, cinematic feel. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>I also added motion titles to replicate the style of a movie teaser trailer, using the mystery of the visuals to intrigue audiences and spark curiosity rather than spelling everything out. The video was conceptualized, shot, and edited in just a few hours because I was under the same time constraints as the teams.</p>

          <p>This video was created as part of a social media series called Air Force Insights (a play on words - insights vs "in sights") that was intended to be both informational and entertaining, focusing on current Air Force priorities.

      <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p> I'm a creative storyteller, video producer, and motion graphics artist with 20 years of experience bringing ideas to life. I’ve built my career around crafting compelling visual narratives, whether through video production, animation, or multimedia design. I love finding new ways to engage audiences, tell meaningful stories, and create content that sticks.</p>

          <p>My experience until now has primarily been with the United States Air Force, and that has led to into several unique positions.  As a teacher at the Defense Information School, I led a team of instructors teaching advanced video production, motion graphics, and storytelling. I developed hands-on courses in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Illustrator, mentoring students to refine their skills and build industry-ready portfolios. Before that, as a Communication Specialist at the Pentagon, I produced high-impact multimedia content, created motion graphics, and supported high-level communication initiatives. My time as a Video Producer at the Defense Media Activity had me managing projects from concept to completion, producing content for broadcast, digital platforms, and social media campaigns.</p>
              
          <p>Beyond my professional work, I’m always looking for ways to push my creativity. I even built this portfolio site from scratch using just HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript—because why not? On top of that, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Web & Digital Design at the University of Maryland Global Campus to expand my digital media expertise.</p>

          <p>At the end of the day, I love what I do. Whether it’s producing a video, designing motion graphics, or helping someone develop their skills, my goal is always the same—create something engaging, impactful, and memorable.</p>
