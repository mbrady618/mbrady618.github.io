            <p>This video was developed at the request of former Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein.  It was played at the annual Air, Space & Cyber Conference in 2017 to communicate his vision for the future of U.S. Military Command and Control.</p>
            <p>It demonstrates a theoretical scenario in which the warfare “domains” (air, ground, space, etc) work in unison to accomplish a mission. Control centers around the globe would be connected through a network that recommends options and calculates the probability of success for each action.</p>  
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>To create the environment, I set up three computer monitors in a studio and lit the scene with plenty of mood and contrast to make it feel like a control room.  I used different color gels so the audience could easily distinguish when the location changed.  </p>
            <p>I designed the computer interface for each domain using Adobe After Effects.  This was the most time-intensive step, because the computer screen actions needed to match what was happening in the script.  I recorded the actors tapping and swiping the screens, which were simply playing the videos I created. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>Some of the extra b-roll (such as vehicles and aircraft) came from video archives. I did all the camera work for the "control center" footage and edited the entire video, focusing heavily on sound design and creating most of the motion graphic elements.</p>

            <p>This video was created for a motion graphics class at UMGC.  The assignment was to develop an animated scene using Adobe After Effects.  I wanted to recreate a story that people might find familiar, choosing the classic fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood.  I began without a clear vision in mind, crafting the structure intuitively as the project developed.</p>

            <p>When I reached the pivotal moment in the story where she confronts the Big Bad Wolf, I was inspired to move in a different direction. I turned the confrontation into a motivational message about dealing with frightening situations. I wanted to show how someone might deliberately imagine themselves as bigger and more powerful to effectively deal with their fears.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>I layered trees in the fore-, mid-, and background to create a multi-dimensional look as she walked through the forest, using masks to make the text appear and disappear as she passed by. Many elements came from stock sites, though I often modified them in Photoshop and Illustrator. </p>

            Date: 07/30/2023<br>
            48 Hour Film Project, Baltimore
            </p></div>
            <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>This video was created for a 48-hour film festival where teams of filmmakers had only two days to write, shoot, and edit a short film. The required elements, including a character, a prop, and a phrase, were revealed when the event kicked off. Each team was also randomly assigned two genres and had to produce their film in the style of one or both. </p>
            <p>Our genres were "romance" and "medical." We had to feature a prop that was pink, a character named Rita Pelepano (a farmer's market vendor), and incorporate "that is not what I had in mind" into the script.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>Friday night, my team of three brainstormed story ideas and stayed up most of the night writing the script. We wanted to use both genres to show that we didn’t have a pre-written story. This is one of my favorite parts of the process because I thrive in a group dynamic where we build off each other's ideas.</p>
            <p>We started shooting the next morning at a predesignated location with actors we knew. I served as director of photography and was one of two camera operators. That night was spent doing post-production with very little rest. Two of us took turns editing or sleeping.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>The video was due that evening, but by noon we realized it was well over the maximum time limit and had to cut nearly 5 minutes. After a few rushed hours, we managed to trim it down while keeping a good flow and successfully maintaining a solid story arc. The film ultimately won an award for Cinematography at the culmination event.</p>

    <p>This video was developed for the annual DC Video Shootoff, which is a not-for-profit video workshop for military and civil service videographers that focuses on storytelling fundamentals and provides mentorship and instruction regarding various aspects of video production. </p>
    <p>I was part of the social media team and was tasked to create a video that promoted the event and highlighted that the teams were about to begin filming.</p>  
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <p>My initial vision was to creatively depict how a team might assemble video gear to shoot their story. I thought it would be fun to emulate how a movie might show an agent gearing up for a mission.</p>
    <p>I used dynamic lighting to highlight various pieces of equipment that resembled tactical gear, capturing close-up shots of the action. During the edit, I added sci-fi-inspired sound effects to enhance the illusion and give the sequence an engaging, cinematic feel. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <p>I also added motion titles to replicate the style of a movie teaser trailer, using the mystery of the visuals to intrigue audiences and spark curiosity rather than spelling everything out. The video was conceptualized, shot, and edited in just a few hours because I was under the same time constraints as the teams.</p>

            <p>This video was developed for a motion graphics class at UMGC.  The assignment was to create a video that demonstrated kinetic typography using a speech or poem.</p>
            <p>I wanted to use source material that felt familiar to audiences, and this poem by William Shakespeare is widely recognized. I also thought it would be interesting to pair it with a musical style that wouldn’t typically be associated with Shakespeare.</p>  
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>I built the entire video as a single composition in Adobe After Effects, incorporating music so that the text would appear, move, and animate in harmony with it. I designed most of the visuals but sourced some graphical elements from stock imagery websites.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I’ve done many motion graphic projects in this style because I enjoy editing directly to music, creating animations that naturally flow with the beat. </p>

            <p>I used a variety of colors that corresponded with the words, strategically emphasizing key terms to make them stand out.

          <div class="col-lg-4">
          <p>This short film was created for a video production class at Syracuse University. It follows a developmentally stunted man who carries around "baggage," symbolized by a paper bag that he wears on his head, and is haunted by a relic from his past: a childhood birthday card he once tried to give his father.</p>  
          <p>I collaborated with three classmates and was involved at every stage of production. We brainstormed several quirky ideas, including a character named Quinn Lively (an homage to Bob Ross and his iconic painting show) who Baghead subconsciously channels throughout the film. After outlining the key plot points in our treatment, we drafted a basic script, which one team member then expanded with dialogue and narration. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          
          <p>We filmed over several days, carefully planning each scene as a team — often juggling multiple production roles. We wrote the script in a way that didn't require a lot of acting. Having one basic character with a bag over his head made that simple. His lines were primarily voice-over and most of the other characters (mainly played by children of the team members) didn't have lines.</p>
          <p>I spent several days completing the primary edit, reviewing hours of footage to select the strongest takes. Some scenes had been filmed with only loose concepts in mind, so it was up to me to shape them into a cohesive narrative during post-production. For the soundtrack, a classmate outside our team shared an album from his band, Perspicuous, which I layered throughout the film.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <p>I also contributed several other key elements to the video, such as using After Effects to composite Quinn Lively into the environment as Baghead's motivation, and using GarageBand to create the tribal drum music for his dance around the fire. Reflecting on this project, which is now over a decade old, I’m still proud of the effort I put into it. While there are many aspects I would approach differently if given the chance to create it again, I still believe it holds up as a solid piece of amateur cinema.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>This video was created as part of a 48-hour film festival where teams had just two days to write, shoot, and edit a short film. The required elements—a character, prop, and line of dialogue—were revealed Friday evening and the film was due by Sunday.  Each team was also randomly assigned two genres and had to write their script in the style of either. </p>
            <p>Our genres were "comedy" and "spy/espionage." The required prop was a frisbee and we needed to include a character named Leon Kane who was a restaurant critic. The line given to us was: "C'mon, let's brainstorm."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>My writing partner and I spent over half the night crafting a script. We ended up using both genres, though “comedy” was applied loosely. It wasn’t laugh-out-loud funny, but it had plenty of quirky charm.</p>
            <p>The next day, we teamed up with a group of fellow filmmakers and actors, many of whom we’d just met. After grabbing our gear we set out to find a location. Our first stop was a state park, but after 30 minutes of shooting a couple of meddling park rangers shut us down.  We moved the rest of our operation to the home of one of the team members.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>After an exhaustive day of shooting, most of the crew disbanded. However, another editor and I pushed on, staying up through the night and well into the next day to piece everything together. I’ve always loved the editing process, and despite the long hours, it was rewarding to see everything come together—we were proud of what we created in such a short time.</p>

I was given the task to "create a short animation that was both Christmas-ey and Air Force-ey," from which I decided to develop a scene that included military equipment and seasonal decorations.</p>

            <p>Eventually, I landed on the idea of decorating an F-35 aircraft with Christmas lights. Since pulling this off in real life would’ve been logistically impossible, I created it in After Effects by designing a flickering light and then digitally compositing different color varitions of it onto a still image of the plane.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>I timed the lights to blink with the tempo of the music and filled the air with a flurry of snowfall. To top it off, I added a flying sleigh and a short holiday message.</p>

        <p class="pt-3 mb-0">I'm a creative storyteller, video producer, and motion graphic designer with 20 years of experience bringing ideas to life. I’ve built my career around crafting compelling visual narratives, whether through video production, animation, or multimedia design. I love finding new ways to engage audiences, tell meaningful stories, and create content that sticks.</p>

          <p>My experience until now has primarily been with the United States Air Force, and that has led to several unique opportunities.  As a teacher at the Defense Information School, I led a team of instructors teaching advanced video production, motion graphics, and storytelling. I developed hands-on courses in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Audition, mentoring students to refine their skills and build industry-standard products.</p> 
            
          <p>Previously, as a Communication Specialist at the Pentagon, I produced multimedia content that supported high-level communication initiatives. Before that, I was at the Defense Media Activity where I managed large scale video projects from concept to completion, producing content for broadcast, digital platforms, and social media campaigns. Immediately prior, I had spent a year studying advanced motion media at Syracuse University after being selected for the prestigious Military Visual Journalism program.</p>
              
          <p>Beyond my professional work, I’m always looking for ways to push my creativity. I work on creative projects in my free time, compose music, and even built this portfolio site from scratch using just HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. On top of that, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Web & Digital Design at the University of Maryland Global Campus to expand my digital media expertise.</p>

          <p>At the end of the day, I love what I do. Whether it’s producing a video, designing motion graphics, or helping someone develop their skills, my goal is always the same—create something engaging, impactful, and memorable.</p>
